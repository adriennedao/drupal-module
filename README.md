## Drupal 8 Code Sample

## POSSE (Publish Own Site, Syndicated Elsewhere) Project

## Drupal 8 Custom Module

-  Module: The function is being created in the module posse_dc
   to render the blog posts and portfolio on the homepage using Drupal hook_preprocess and pass $variables to it by its reference.

-  TWIG: Twig files can extend and inherits the code from another
   Twig file, "page.html.twig". When working on the extending twig file, you can only override twig blocks from the code you are inheriting, and that is what is showing in between the opening and closing {% block content %} twig tags.
